# Mars Rover 
Flask App Calling NASA Mars Rover API 

---

## Project Summary
This project employs the Flask framework to develop a simple web application that calls the NASA Mars Rover API. 
This API is designed to collect image data gathered by NASA's Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit rovers on Mars and make it more easily available to educators of earth science studies.
Unit Testing was executed with python's unittest module. Static Analysis was conducted with Pep8 Automation tools and bandit. 
App was set-up in a virtual environment thats is, an isolated Python runtime environments to isolate if from other python evironments in users machine. This may be vital if runtime dependencies differ between frameworks or libraries.
